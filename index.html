                             A Huawei Case Study on HSBC revealed that they are stargetgially putting emphasis on "partnership and data at the heart of digitisation". The study looked at how HSBC are further leveraging cloud computing and 
                             big data to deliver real-time services, and more intelligent business decisions. Recent Research on what are termed "smart branches" argues that combinaing AI, 5G and cloud servcies enables banks to deploy outlets
                             that are essentially self servicing terminal, which can both help with customer interactions from the bank's standpoint and reduce staff and property cost.

                            HSBC majorly scaled its infrastructure in 2022. Google Cloud case material reports over 100 petabytes of data being transferred into cloud environments, enabling HSBC to increase
                            its compute power and undertake more advanced modelling and anti-crime analytics. 
                            Furthermore, this migration strengthens HSBC's data maturity profile as data becomes more accessible and available for AI and analytics. This move also strengthens HSBC's governance and security
                            as encryption and monitoring is diversified across multuple regualtors and regions.
